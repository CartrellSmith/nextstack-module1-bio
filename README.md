# NeXTStack — Week 1 Day 2: Bio Page

## What I built
A semantic HTML bio page with sections, lists, links, and an image.

## How to run it
Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## What I learned
- (example) Semantic HTML helps structure content clearly.
- (example) File paths must match folder names exactly.

## What was challenging
- (example) My image didn’t load at first because the filename didn’t match.

## Next improvement
- Add CSS styling in Week 2.
